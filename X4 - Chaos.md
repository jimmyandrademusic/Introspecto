# Chaos
## Lyrics and chords
(Jimmy Andrade)

### Intro
C9 Am Em Dm 
### Verses 1
<pre>
Dm Am Em Cm

One day you will see
That, despite everything
There is one thing you can believe

One day you'll see
That my world needs you
So, please, pay attention
You're the one who makes the future
</pre>
### Bridge 1
<pre>
Em Am F Fm
When the chaos comes close to me
The only light you'll see
Where will it come from?
</pre>
### Chorus
<pre>
C9 Am Em Dm
No, I will break all the rules
“Chaos is all around us”
It’ll be my talk to humans

Yes, you can take all the roads
But you don’t know where your life goes
That's what I say to humans
</pre>
### Verses 2
<pre>
I see the same as you see
But you’d never believe
If there was a chance of a revolution

It looks like what I hear
Now is the time that we’ll see
     Em      C9
The final conclusion
</pre>
### Bridge 2
<pre>
And my world will ask for help
And your world will ask for help
Then you will realize that yours and mine

They were always one world
‘Cause there’s only one world. (4 times)
</pre>
### Chorus
<pre>
C9 Am Em Dm
No, I will break all the rules
“Chaos is all around us”
It’ll be my talk to humans

Yes, you can take all the roads
But you don’t know where your life goes
That's what I say to humans
</pre>
### Outro
<pre>
To these humans
To these humans
To these humans, saying

One day you'll see
Things are in fact already
The final conclusion
</pre>
