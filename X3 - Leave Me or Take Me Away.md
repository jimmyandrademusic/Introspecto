# Leave Me or Take Me Away
## Lyrics
(Jimmy Andrade)
### Verses
<pre>
What did I do to you
For you to hurt me so much
Is it ‘cause you have all things
That I couldn’t have too

Maybe they’re not in this world
Or maybe I am nothing in this one
Believe me, please, this way my life can’t go on
</pre>
### Chorus
<pre>
And I do not want anyone to see
How much I'm crying ‘cause you hurt me
And even so, I miss you
But I know it’s too late
For you to see that you were a fool
I wanna run away
</pre>
### Verses
<pre>
Who was I? Who are you?
And now, my life… where is it going?
Please tell me, I need some explanation!
</pre>
### Chorus
<pre>
And I do not want anyone to see
How much I'm crying ‘cause you hurt me
And even so, I miss you
But I know it’s too late
For you to see that you were a fool
I'm gonna run away
So leave me or take me away
</pre>
